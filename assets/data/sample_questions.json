    "modelAnswer": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by reversible airflow obstruction. The pathophysiology involves airway inflammation, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and mucus hypersecretion. Bronchodilators (beta-2 agonists) work by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle, providing immediate symptom relief. Corticosteroids target the underlying inflammation, reducing airway hyperresponsiveness and preventing exacerbations.",

Key differentials include ischemic stroke (most common), hemorrhagic stroke, TIA, and stroke mimics (hypoglycemia, Todd's paresis, hemiplegic migraine). Immediate investigations should include: urgent non-contrast CT head to rule out hemorrhage, blood glucose, ECG, basic bloods (FBC, U&E, coagulation), and consideration for CT angiography if thrombolysis is being considered. Time is critical - use FAST assessment and aim for door-to-needle time under 60 minutes if thrombolysis indicated.",
